	abstract = {More than 15\% of all vascular plant species may remain scientifically undescribed, and many of the \&gt;340,000 described species have no or few geographic records documenting their distribution. Identifying and understanding taxonomic and geographic knowledge shortfalls is key to prioritising future collection and conservation efforts.Using extensive data for 343,754 vascular plant species and time-to-event analyses, we conducted multiple tests related to plant taxonomic and geographic data shortfalls, and identified 29 global diversity darkspots (regions expected to lack most information about their species diversity and distribution by 2050). We defined priority regions for future collection according to several socio-economic and environmental scenarios.Our understanding of the global diversity and distribution of vascular plant species is estimated to remain incomplete and biased by 2050 under current collection patterns. Most plant diversity darkspots are found within biodiversity hotspots, except New Guinea. We identify the Philippines, Myanmar, Assam, Bangladesh, East Himalaya, Iran, Turkey, Colombia, and Peru, as global collection priorities under all environmental and socio-economic conditions considered.Our study provides a framework to accelerate plant species documentation for the implementation of conservation actions. As digitisation of the world{\textquoteright}s herbaria progresses, collection and conservation priorities may soon be identifiable at finer scales.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
