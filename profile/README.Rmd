## Background

Recent estimates indicate that **more than 15% of the world’s vascular plant species remain scientifically unknown** and many known species have no geographic records documenting their distribution. Identifying knowledge gaps and understanding their historical drivers is thus essential to guide the prioritization of data collection and to inform conservation strategies at global and national scales. 
We believe that using metrics of diversity knowledge gaps provides valuable and complementary information to further develop and improve conservation actions.\  

## Approach
Using the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) and a range of species- and human-related variables known to influence species discovery and detection, our team model the time to species’ first description and geolocation to predict how many species are currently scientifically unknown and lack geolocation [@Ondo2023.09.12.557387]. We investigate (mis-)matches between the 36 known biodiversity hotspots (i.e., areas with exceptional concentration of endemic and threatened species) and areas with most important gaps in taxonomic and geographic knowledge (i.e., plant diversity “darkspots”), and the importance of the socioeconomic context of countries when prioritising regions for future collection efforts.
